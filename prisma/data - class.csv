RELS 3560,"Living Deliberately: Monks, Saints, and the Contemplative Life",Justin McDaniel,"Students who are not Religious Studies Majors and are not honors students must gain permission from instructor to enroll in this course. This is an experimental course in which students will experience monastic and ascetic ways of living. There will be no examinations, no formal papers, and very little required reading. However, each participant will need to be fully committed intellectually and participate in the monastic rules in the course involving restrictions on dress, technology, verbal communication, and food. The course subject matter is about ways in which nuns, monks, shamens, and swamis in various religious traditions (Buddhist, Muslim, Catholic, Jain, Taoist, Hindu, Animist, among others) have used poetry, meditation, mind-altering chemicals, exercise, magic, and self-torture to cope with pain and suffering, as well as struggle with spiritual, ethical, and metaphysical questions concerning the nature of the soul, the afterlife, and reality. Through monastic and spiritual practice, this course hopes to provide students with an opportunity to struggle with these questions themselves.
Not Offered Every Year"
FNAR 1110,The Big Picture: Mural Arts in Philadelphia,Jane Golden Heriza,"In this course, students will have the opportunity to learn everything about murals — and help create one themselves. After learning about today’s mural arts movement and how it is used for social change, students will analyze the mural design process itself. They will then team up with Philadelphia high school students and community groups to paint a large outdoor mural in West Philadelphia. 
The professor is the executive director of the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, and Shira Walinsky, a mural arts painter and the founder of the Southeast by Southeast project, a community center for Burmese refugees in South Philadelphia. Philadelphia’s Mural Arts Program is the nation’s largest public arts program and has produced nearly 4,000 murals. "
ENGL 3308,Cooking with Words,Gabrielle Hamilton,"Taught by New York Times Magazine food columnist and restaurateur Gabrielle Hamilton, ENGL 3308 is a writing workshop that is all about food. The course will take students through the works of authors who have written about food, and students will then have the chance to write prose on a non-food topic through the lens of food. One example, listed in the course description, is a story about the end of a friendship because of how someone spoke to the waitress at a restaurant. 

Course readings will include art critic John Berger, poet Ogden Nash, and Canadian singer-songwriter KD Lang. "
COMM 4630,Surveillance Capitalism,Joseph Turow,"Have you ever wondered how Google knows to show you an ad about the thing you were just talking about with your friend? COMM 4630 delves into the term that is increasingly used to describe this encroachment of technology on our lives: surveillance capitalism. The course will examine how large companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon use surveillance capitalism — including artificial intelligence and “big data” analyses — to increase their profits, affect the job you are offered, customize the ads you see, and much more. 

COMM 4630 is taught by Communication professor Joseph Turow, whose research includes conducting national surveys on issues surrounding media and marketing. "

ENGL 0759,"Gender, Ecology and New Wave Science Fiction",Barri Gold,"The artist deals with what cannot be said in words. The artist whose medium is fiction does this in words. The novelist says in words what cannot be said in words. --Ursula Le Guin Literature is a way to think. Good literature can help us wrestle with some of the most intractable, often unconscious or unacknowledged, issues of its moment and ours. The novels in this course do so by imagining alien worlds with distinctive and strange ecologies. Through the imagined Mars of H.G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds, the evolutionary mystery of Orson Scott Card’s Speaker for the Dead, and the waterworld of Joan Slonczewski’s A Door Into Ocean, we will explore the interrelations between gender, colonialism, language and ecology. Student will have an opportunity to write their own ecological speculative fiction. And we will read two of the best science fiction novels of all time—Frank Herbert’s Dune and Ursula Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness—which helped launch a “new wave” of science fiction, more political, more psychological, and more literary."
SWRK 7280,Taking Down the Prison Industrial Complex,Toorjo Ghose,"The U.S. incarcerates more people than any other country, and more than any nation has ever done in history. The racial disparities that mark this carceral regime have led scholars to describe the prison industrial complex as a new form of Jim Crow. Philadelphia has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, and one of the largest populations on parole and probation. This class explores structural and individual-level pathways to re-engage the vast population of recently incarcerated people who cycle through prisons, jails, juvenile homes, and other detention centers. Drawing on practice informed by critical race, postcolonial, feminist, and queer theories, the class prepares the conceptual and practice foundations for a prison abolitionist orientation in social work engagement with this community. Utilizing a daily workshop format that incorporates members of the Philadelphia decarcerate landscape, students will be trained in direct and macro practice, to engage with people and the carceral systems they are embedded in. The class will engage students with the innovative psychotherapeutic and macro practices being implemented in the Center for Carceral Communities at SP2, alternative programs in Philadelphia’s municipal and federal courts, educational degree programs at community colleges in Philadelphia, co-operative business initiatives for people emerging from incarceration, and social movements such as Black Lives Matter that are shaping the prison abolition landscape. The class blends morning sessions dedicated to discussions of texts with afternoon sessions dedicated to hands-on implementation workshops. At the end of the class, students will be prepared to immediately start engaging with members of the community emerging from incarceration."

VCSN 8855,Equine Ophthalmology - NBC,Nicole Scherrer,"This course is designed to provide students with ophthalmology experience to supplement what they obtain in the Large Animal Medicine foundation rotation, and, if taken, the Small Animal Ophthalmology elective. It is intended both for students with a special interest in ophthalmology, to broaden their exposure to include equine ophthalmology, and for equine students, to provide them with ophthalmology training that will benefit their equine patients in either general or speciality practice. This latter is particularly important given that most equine students do not take the Small Animal Ophthalmology elective and so graduate without clinical ophthalmology experience. Students will participate in the diagnosis and treatment of clinical ophthalmology cases in the hospital. Students will assist with evaluation of new cases, both inpatient and outpatient, and will be responsible for the daily treatment and examination of all hospitalized ophthalmology cases. Students will handle communication with clients and construct discharge summaries when appropriate. Exposure will vary due to fluctuations in case load. Organized laboratories in slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and tonometry will allow the student to become comfortable with ophthalmic diagnostic techniques."

PHYS 0080,Physics and Consciousness,Marija Drndic,"We will explore the basic classical and quantum physics concepts, and link themto newly observed physical phenomena and technologies, as well as to brain research, in the context of tools that physicists helped bring about like the seminal magnetic resonance imaging. The course content is mostly physics, although we link it to cognitive sciences, but the main focus is on motivating and explaining the basic physical laws behind new phenomena and related technologies. Examples include wave-particle duality and its relevance for technological applications, behavior of spin particles in a magnetic field to explain magnetic resonance imaging, ion flow through ion channels and ohm's law to explain electrical signal flow in our body, and other examples within the core of physics and bridging to interdisciplinary areas of material science and devices, biology and neuroscience. As we learn about particle spins, we will talk about brain imaging studies enabled by Nobel winning physics research. We will then discuss consciousness and free will, and read original texts by Schrodinger, Einstein and other physicists, and our course discussion will be uniquely motivated by related physical phenomena and experiments, including quantum entanglement and relativity of space and time. I will explain the basic ideas behind quantum computing and information processing, and we we learn about basic quantum logicgates and Dirac's matrix formalism in quantum mechanics."
SWRK 7330,Supporting LGBTQ+ Individuals Across the Lifespan,Elicia Gonzales,"As recognition and acceptance of individuals across and beyond both the sexual orientation and gender identity spectrums continues to progress within the United States, clinical theory and applications for working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer plus (LGBTQ+) individuals has also expanded. This course will explore the clinical theories and treatment approaches geared towards affirming and supporting LGBTQ+ individuals within their romantic and/or sexual relationships, families of origin, and families of choice. Areas of development will be addressed across the lifespan including specific milestones related to gender and sexuality development as well as psychological, sociocultural, and spiritual influences upon development. Centering on a social justice approach, learners will be encouraged to critically examine systemic factors impacting LGBTQ+ individuals as well as the intersectionality of various identities including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability/disability, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, mental and physical health, and other identities (both self-assigned and externally applied) that can impact development. Each stage of development will include multiple cases for review and consideration of potential practice implications at the individual, relationship, family, community, and systemic levels. Upon conclusion of the course, learners will have a stronger understanding of the practice theories that exist, the practice models that best fit their professional style, and clear understanding of practice application in regards to affirming and supporting LGBTQ+ individuals."
COMM 3950,Communication and the Presidency,"Dwight Eisenhower,
Scott Reich",This course examines the vital aspect of communication as a tool of the modern Presidency. Reading and class discussions focus on case studies drawn from modern Presidential administrations (beginning with FDR) that demonstrate the elements of successful and unsuccessful Presidential initiatives and the critical factor of communication common to both. This course is also an introduction to primary research methods and to the use of primary research materials in the Presidential Library system.
ENGL 3010,Introduction to Creative Writing: Poetry and Fiction,Ahmad Almallah,"This introductory workshop explores the main tools of writing poetry and fiction. Thematically, we’ll be reading a number of different examples to learn why poets such as Gwendolyn Brooks and Sylvia Plath turn to fiction as a way to revitalize their poetic practice, and why novelists such as Herman Hesse and Herta Müller turn to poetry. And we’ll read writers who work in both genres, such Zbigniew Herbert and Salim Barakat. Students will learn to use the main tools of fiction, such as characterization, dialogue, and description, as well as the forms of poetry, such as sound, image, and enjambment. The workshop also aims at encouraging a philosophical exploration of the border between reality and imagination in the form of writing poems and short fiction pieces."
MGMT 3530,Wharton Field Challenge FLCP,Keith Weigelt,"Do you want to make a real difference in the lives of a student? Do you want to set kids on a path to becoming financially literate? Do you want to learn leadership skills in the classroom? Here at the Financial Literacy Community Project (FLCP) we are able to create an experience that achieves all three. We partner with various public schools around the West Philadelphia area and teach concepts integral to financial literacy. We teach a wide range of grades from middle school to high school, and work with students to help them learn how to be financially responsible. In addition to teaching in neighboring high schools, we also have group class meetings run by Professor Keith Weigelt on Mondays from 7:00 PM-8:30 PM. We learn about the disparity of wealth and how to best address it while also learning teaching techniques, classroom strategies, and overall basic financial literacy. A basic understanding of personal financial literacy is required."
OIDD 4810,Convex Optimization for Statistics and Data Science,Yuxin Chen,"Convex optimization has become a real pillar of modern data science and has transformed algorithm designs. A wide spectrum of problems in statistics, machine learning, and engineering can be formulated as optimization tasks that exhibit favorable convexity properties, which admit standardized and efficient solutions. This course aims to introduce the elements of convex optimization, concentrating on modeling aspects and algorithms that are useful in data science applications. Topics include convex sets, convex functions, linear and quadratic programs, semidefinite programming, optimality conditions and duality theory. We will visit important applications in statistics and machine learning to demonstrate the wide applicability of convex optimization. We will also cover effective optimization algorithms like gradient descent and Newton's method. Prerequisites: Basic linear algebra (Math 3120, 3130, 3140 or equivalent), basic calculus (Math 2400 or equivalent), basic probability (STAT 4300 or equivalent), and knowledge of a programming language like MATLAB or Python to conduct simulation exercises."

It continues the treatment of statics of rigid bodies begun in MEAM 1100/PHYS 0150 and progresses to the treatment of deformable bodies and their response to loads. The concepts of stress, strain, and linearly elastic response are introduced and applied to the behavior of rods, shafts, beams and other mechanical components. The failure and design of mechanical components are discussed. Students should have either taken MATH 2400 in a previous semester or be taking it concurrently with this course."
STSC 2421,Manufacturing Minds: From Babbage to ChatGPT,David Dunning,"When asked to tell its own history, ChatGPT answers literally, describing (vaguely of course) its own training data set. When pressed to describe the longer history of “technology like you,” it mentions early computer science, programs that played chess or solved math problems, before naming deep learning algorithms and big data as the key breakthroughs. This lineage is not untrue, but it ignores the wider context in which individuals and organizations have come to pursue this strange dream of crafting an intelligent object. As an uncannily lucid conversation partner who freely performs all manner of textual tasks, ChatGPT participates in a longstanding tension in the history of information technology between the goals of manufacturing minds and making mindless clerical workers. In this course we historicize that tension in three domains—calculation, knowledge work, and games—all of which directly inform our efforts to imagine what ChatGPT and its ilk might be. Throughout, we will attend to the ways machinery shaped specific tasks’ construction in relation to gender, race, and class identities. We will see how technologies often imagined as disembodied are always material, interacting with human bodies and physical environments."
CHEM 5450,Chemical Neuroscience,Dirk Trauner,"Natural products, such as tetrodotoxin, kainic acid and morphine, have played a crucial role in the development of neuroscience. Using selected chemical syntheses as a framework, I will provide an introduction to neuroscience for chemists blended with an intense course in synthetic design (""Syntheseplanung""). The structure, function and synthesis of the following molecules will be analyzed: tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin, kainic acid, nicotine, epibatidine, coniine, tubocurarine, histrionicotoxin, ibotenic acid, strychnine, picrotine, chrysanthemic acid, ivermectin, muscarine, morphine, salvinorin A, THC, lysergic acid, forskolin, staurosporin, eglumegad, physostigmine, huperzin A, galanthamine, cocaine, reserpine, thapsigargin, ouabagenin, ryanodine, capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, retinal, carotene, menthol, santalol, camphor, and the prostaglandins. The structure and function of important ion channels, GPCRs, transporters and enzymes and their ligands will be discussed using PyMol files. The goal of this course is to get as many synthetic chemists excited about neuroscience as possible (and a few neuroscientists stoked about synthesis). The importance of structural and pharmacological databases (PDB and IUPHAR, respectively) and the usefulness of the Reaxys database (and SciFinder) for synthetic planning will be demonstrated. Requirements: A familiarity with synthetic organic chemistry and (named) chemical reactions, a mastery of the Nernst equation, and a willingness to learn more about one of the greatest, if not the greatest scientific challenges of our times: to figure out how the human brain work"

NURS 3270,Foundations of Global Health,Jianghong Liu,"This interdisciplinary course covers fundamental concepts of global and population health. Epidemiology and methodology, historical and contemporary contexts, physical (water, air, climate change, and food/nutrition) and social (health inequities, sex/reproduction, injury/violence) determinants of health, and interventions for health improvement are addressed. Health problems such as infectious and chronic diseases cannot be understood apart from history, economics, environment, and inequalities - they are not simply medical issues. Global Health refers not only to the health problems of ""others"" living in far corners of the world (low- and middle-income countries), but also to our own health problems as citizens of a very rich, but very unequal and multicultural nation. The aim of the course is to help students become more informed and active global citizens. Learning methods include faculty presentations, student presentations, and small group discussions. Although this course has a health focus, it is aimed at all students interested in global issues."

Fulfills quantitative data analysis requirement."
ANTH 1151,Madness and Mental Health in East Asian Worlds,Emily Ng,"Madness, however conceived, can trouble the limits of our worlds. Since COVID-19, questions of mental health have resurfaced with a sense of urgency, as many faced unprecedented changes in collective and intimate life. This course explores madness and mental health in East Asian worlds, across geographies, histories, social-political transformations, and racialized imaginations. How do East Asian therapeutics approach madness, through and beyond the concepts of psychiatry, neuroscience, or even ‘mental health’? What happens when Euro-American diagnostic categories and treatments travel to East Asia as part of missionary and empire-building projects? Bringing together readings in medical and psychological anthropology, as well as history, literature, psychoanalysis, and transcultural psychiatry, we will explore themes such as: shifting concepts of madness in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese medical and spiritual cures, colonial legacies of ‘culture-bound syndromes,’ and race as a site of psychic struggle in Asian American diasporas."
ANTH 3045,Oil to Diamonds: The Political Economy of Natural Resources in Africa,Adewale Adebanwi,"This course examines the ways in which the processes of the extraction, refining, sale and use of natural resources – including oil and diamond – in Africa produce complex regional and global dynamics. We explore how values are placed on resources, how such values, the regimes of valuation, commodification and the social formations that are (re)produced by these regimes lead to cooperation and conflict in the contemporary African state, including in the relationships of resource-rich African countries with global powers. Specific cases will be examined against the backdrop of theoretical insights to encourage comparative analyses beyond Africa. Some audio-visual materials will be used to enhance the understanding of the political economy and sociality of natural resources."

Specifically, we evaluate the challenges facing health care organizations using competitive analysis, identify their past responses, and explore the current strategies they are using to manage these challenges (and emerging ones) more effectively. Students will develop generalized skills in competitive analysis and the ability to apply those skills in the specialized analysis of opportunities in producer (e.g. biopharmaceutical, medical product, information technology), purchaser (e.g. insurance), and provider (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes, physician) organizations and industry sectors. The course is organized around a number of readings, cases, presentations, and a required project."
JWST 0020,Religions of the West,Reyhan Durmaz,"This course surveys the intertwined histories of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We will focus on the shared stories which connect these three traditions, and the ways in which communities distinguished themselves in such shared spaces. We will mostly survey literature, but will also address material culture and ritual practice, to seek answers to the following questions: How do myths emerge? What do stories do? What is the relationship between religion and myth-making? What is scripture, and what is its function in creating religious communities? How do communities remember and forget the past? Through which lenses and with which tools do we define ""the West""?"
MEAM 4150,Product Design,"Ashley Marcovitz,
Karl Ulrich","This course provides tools and methods for creating new products. The course is intended for students with a strong career interest in new product development, entrepreneurship, and/or technology development. The course follows an overall product design methodology, including the identification of customer needs, generation of product concepts, prototyping, and design-for-manufacturing. Weekly student assignments are focused on the design of a new product and culminate in the creation of a prototype, which is launched at an end-of-semester public Design Fair. The course project is a physical good - but most of the tools and methods apply to services and software products. The course is open to any Penn sophomore, junior, senior or graduate student. The course follows a studio format, in which students meet for three hours each week with Professor Marcovitz for lectures and hands-on making, and students will complete 90 minutes of asynchronous, self-paced content from Professor Ulrich on their own time each week. Professor Ulrich gives one in-person lecture during the semester and attends the Design Fair, but is not present at the weekly studio sessions."
COMM 2820,Sick and Satired - The Insanity of Humor and How it Keeps Us Sane,Dwayne Booth,"This course will examine how and why humor, as both an instigator and peacemaker, might be considered one of the most influential and profoundly useful forms of communication devised by human beings. The unique ability of jokes and satire to transcend familiar literary and journalistic forms for the purpose of deepening (or cheapening) socio-philosophical arguments and to inspire (or discourage) debate and participation in public conversations about innumerable political and social issues will be explored. The fearless analytical nature of both high and lowbrow comedy will be examined, as well as its deflective qualities. The course will enable students to consider, through analysis of both contemporary and historical examples, the political and cultural satirist's unique role in society as a witness, a predictor and, in some circumstances, an instigator of public and private debate. We will examine the role of satire in revealing and mediating differences between disparate social groups based not solely on language differences, but also on political affiliation, cultural identity, ethnicity, gender, religious fellowship, sexual orientation, and socio-economic caste."

AFRC 4000,Blacks in American Film and Television,Donald Bogle,"This course is an examination and analysis of the changing images and achievements of African Americans in motion pictures and television. The first half of the course focuses on African-American film images from the early years of D.W. Griffith's ""renegade bucks"" in The Birth of a Nation (1915); to the comic servants played by Steppin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, and others during the Depression era; to the post-World War II New Negro heroes and heroines of Pinky (1949) and The Defiant Ones (1958); to the rise of the new movement of African American directors such as Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing), Julie Dash (Daughters of the Dust), Charles Burnett, (To Sleep With Anger) and John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood). The second half explores television images from the early sitcoms ""Amos 'n Andy"" and ""Beulah"" to the ""Cosby Show,"" ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"" and ""Martin."" Foremost this course will examine Black stereotypes in American films and television--and the manner in which those stereotypes have reflected national attitudes and outlooks during various historical periods. The in-class screenings and discussions will include such films as Show Boat (1936), the independently produced ""race movies"" of the 1930s and 1940s, Cabin in the Sky (1943), The Defiant Ones (1958), Imitation of Life (the 1959 remake) & Super Fly (1972)."
EALC 1711,East Asian Diplomacy,"F. Dickinson, Do Melo De Nascimento","Home to four of the five most populous states and four of the five largest economies, the Asia/Pacific is arguably the most dynamic region in the twenty-first century. At the same time, Cold War remnants (a divided Korea and China) and major geopolitical shifts (the rise of China and India, decline of the US and Japan) contribute significantly to the volatility of our world. This course will examine the political, economic, and geopolitical dynamism of the region through a survey of relations among the great powers in Asia from the sixteenth century to the present. Special emphasis will be given to regional and global developments from the perspective of the three principal East Asian states--China, Japan and Korea. We will explore the many informal, as well as formal, means of intercourse that have made East Asia what it is today. Graduate students should consult graduate syllabus for graduate reading list, special recitation time and graduate requirements."

Students will work in groups on a current biotechnology topic related to chemical engineering that will be presented to the class and written as a final report. One of the course goals is to prepare students for a successful biotechnology lab experience in CBE 4800. Problem solving, models, open-ended problems, technical communication skills, and teamwork will be emphasized."
ITAL 1430,History of Opera,Mauro Calcagno,"An investigation, through a series of representative works, of the central problem of opera: how does the combination of music, text, and visual spectacle create an art form in which the whole is more powerful than its parts. Today this issue can be examined not only in live performances but also through media such as film, DVD, streaming video-- media to which this four-centuries-old multimedia form has adapted, evolving in still compelling ways. The works chosen for the course provide a chronological survey but also represent the variety of sources on which opera has drawn for it subject matter: myth and legend, the epic, the novel, and the play."
RELS 0305,Great Books of Judaism: Jews Write Their History,Talya Fishman,"Since the early medieval period, Jews have been known as ""the People of the Book"". Yet the books they produced and consumed changed drastically over time and place, spanning a variety of known genres and inventing new ones. These works, in turn, shaped the texts, ideas, and lives of Jews and others for millennia, spawned vast commentary traditions, and inspired new works. This course engages prominent Jewish texts, such as the Hebrew Bible, Rabbinic Literature, the works of major medieval philosophers, pre-modern intellectuals, and modern authors, situating them in their literary, cultural, and social contexts, and examining their later reception."
NRSC 2270,"Drugs, Brain and Mind",Michael Kane,"The course will begin with a review of basic concepts in pharmacology including: routes of drug administration, drug metabolism, the dose response curve, tolerance and sensitization. Following a brief overview of cellular foundations of neuropharmacology (neuronal biology, synaptic and receptor function), the course will focus on several neurotransmitter systems and the molecular and behavioral mechanisms mediating the mind-altering, additive and neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and anxiety with an emphasis on their underlying neurobiological causes, as well as the pharmacological approaches for treatment."
PHYS 4411,Introduction to Quantum Mechanics I,Charles Kane,"An introduction to the principles of quantum mechanics designed for physics majors and graduate students in physics-related disciplines.

CIMS 2665,"Fakes, Forgeries and Forensics in Digital Media",Elizabeth Scheyder,"Fake images on social media are just one of the latest examples of fabrications and modifications that have taken media into dubious territory throughout history. This course will analyze the history of fakes and forgeries and consider whether they devalue the original or not, or even have value in themselves. Along the way, students will learn how fakes and forgeries have been created, what tools can be used to counter the onslaught of illicit creations, and the arts and humanities debates that have arisen surrounding them. After evaluating the ways various media have been modified over time, this course will show students how to use photo manipulation tools to modify digital media. It will also show students how to perform various detailed analyses of digital media to determine their legitimacy. A final project will bring these tools together, as groups of students create a fake or forgery, consider its implications and evaluate a tool’s ability to detect it."
DSGN 2260,Pixel to Print,Kayla Romberger,"This studio course introduces students to the world of print media and circulation through techniques in Risograph (a high-speed digital printing system developed in Japan in the 1980s), xerography, and letterpress, focusing particularly on the format of posters and artists' ephemera. Beginning with the Adobe Creative Suite, students will create their own broadsides, flyers, announcement cards, and print-based installations throughout the course, exploring ways in which artists and designers make use of the printed form to disseminate information; initiate happenings; advertise events; or foment change. Students will learn about some of the most significant producers working within this realm--from Dada to punk bands in the '70s to contemporary hybrid publishing collectives--and develop skills in page layout, typography, and design; digital to analog pre-press and post-print production methods; and mechanized and hand-pulled press operations. The course includes a field trip to NYC."
