PennScience Journal of Undergraduate Research,"PennScience Journal of Undergraduate Research is a student group committed to promoting and raising the visibility of undergraduate research.

Conducting research has become a standard part of many science majors' interests, and many students go above and beyond the call of the minimum requirements, spending long hours and summers in the lab. Some even begin their research careers while still in high school. Yet too often, this work goes unnoticed and unreported.

By creating a scientific forum for and by students, we hope to bring together young researchers, helping to make students feel that rather than participating in a disjointed and isolating endeavor, they are becoming a part of a true community of scholars. We also seek to raise the awareness of the outside community to research performed by undergraduates.

A key goal of our journal is to make publication more accessible to college students, providing a peer-reviewed journal dedicated solely to their work. Publication in academic journals is a time-consuming process which is not always suitable for the duration and scale of projects done by undergraduates; we seek to create another option will allow more students to publish their research."

Argentine Tango is a highly social dance form, emphasizing connection and improvisation. PennTango's membership consists of a fun group of social dancers interested in improving their tango skills and building a larger community to go out dancing with! We are not a performance group, and do not limit membership or hold auditions. We are open to all Penn students, faculty, staff and alumni!"
Penny Loafers A Cappella,"Founded in 1986, the Penny Loafers, or Loaf, is the University of Pennsylvania’s only all-gender indie-pop a cappella group. We perform an eclectic mix of songs in genres ranging from pop & indie to R&B, electronic, and more. To put it simply, we love introducing audiences to songs from up-and-coming artists and reinventing our favorite household jams. "
PennYo,PennYo is Penn's premier Chinese student a cappella group and the first collegiate Chinese a cappella group in the United States. We hope to spread the love for Chinese music to the Philadelphia community and beyond. We welcome students of all backgrounds to audition! Chinese proficiency is not required (we have members from all around the world)! All of our arrangements are written by current and past PennYo members. Check out some of our music!
Polyphonia @ Penn,"Polyphonia is Penn's first student-led joint Orchestra and Choir, performing works from early music to the modern day. We welcome all musicans; though we primarily expect to be composed of those instruments that make up a classical symphonic orchestra and choir, we absolutely are looking for creative ways to include nontraditional instruments into our repertoire as well!
If you're looking for a way to engage with the performing arts, but are worried about time committment, look no further! Polyphonia provides busy students an opportunity to continue engaging with the arts while keeping commitment attainable. Students may find it hard to maintain involvement with the arts while at Penn, so we hope to be able to create a space where they can enjoy music casually with the option of performance.
Furthermore, Polyphonia is a great platform for meeting other musicians of various talents, as our wide reach encompasses many different musical instruments and styles. It's a great way to find others to perform that Brahms quartet you've been dying to do, and we also hope to offer a stage to perform that quartet upon!
Finally, even if you don't play or sing but want to get involved, feel free to get in touch. We're always looking for people who want to help out, whether that be by making playbills, light or sound design, marketing or outreach, or just about anything we can think of!"

Soundworks Tap Factory,"We are a completely student-choreographed team that performs in and produces two shows during each academic year. Our unique style comes from the broad dance foundation of all our members, which includes rhythm tap, Broadway-style tap, hip-hop, jazz, and more! We bring in master tap teachers to help us continue to grow as tappers, though we consistently challenge each other with our own choreography!"
Sparks Dance Co,"Sparks Dance Company (SDC) was founded in 1989 as Penn's premiere dance company dedicated to both performing and community service. The company, which is managed by undergraduate students, maintains a high technical level of many styles of dance including ballet, contemporary, jazz, tap, and hip hop.

In addition to weekly technique classes, each semester culminates with a self-choreographed show. Company members also perform at other popular campus events throughout the year such as the Emily Sachs Dance Benefit, various coffeehouses, and Student Performing Arts Night. In addition to all of these performance opportunities, SDC members share their love of dance through community service at various Philadelphia locales, such as the KIPP schools, the Salvation Army, and the Ronald McDonald house."
Strictly Funk,"Strictly Funk is the premiere hip-hop and contemporary student dance group here at the University of Pennsylvania. The company was formed in 1997 with the intention of transcending the traditional boundaries of dance. It has been developing a performance culture of its own ever since. This diverse company of 20+ members from all of the Penn undergraduate and graduate schools, as well as the greater Philadelphia area, seeks to explore hip-hop, jazz, contemporary, free-styling, lyrical, breaking, locking, popping, and funk, while still recognizing the personal styles of individual dancers. Funk has no limits.

Each Funk show features an overarching theme, of which all numbers aim to explore from a different perspective. Theatrical dances and scenes implore both the audience and the dancers themselves to reconsider conventional paradigms through experimenting with movement. Shows run on a continuous soundtrack, breaking only for intermission, while also incorporating elaborate video and lighting."
TEDxPenn,"TEDxPenn is a nonprofit organization founded in 2010 by students who sought to empower ideas within and around the Penn community. We hold a license at the University of Pennsylvania to host the largest student-run TEDx conference in the world, and today our TedTalks have amassed over 15 million views on Youtube with a wide range of speakers, from NFL players to Penn professors to the creator of Apple Emojis. This coming spring, we plan to host our annual conference where 1000 attendees are invited to engage with TedTalks about technology, entertainment, and design.

The Excelano Project,"The Excelano Project is the University of Pennsylvania’s first and premiere spoken word group. Supposedly derived from Latin, “excelano” means “we march forth” and from its foundation in 2001 by poets and then Penn students Carlos Gomez and Warren Longmire, EP has been doing just that. Performing on campus and having competed at the national level, The Excelano Project has made a name for itself. In 2007 and in 2009 we had the pleasure of taking home the College Union’s Poetry Slam Invitational title. Our poets have been featured at the White House, on HBO, at the famous Nuyorican Poets Cafe, on Broadway, and all around the world.

But EP goes beyond the poetry; we are a family. This group is about finding voice. It is dedicated to the power of the mic and using personal experience to touch the lives of audience members. It’s about breaking down barriers. It’s about holding a speaker up to life’s white noise, to find that every one of us can be heard."
